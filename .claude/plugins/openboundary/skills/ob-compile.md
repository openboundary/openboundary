# Compile OpenBoundary Specification

Compile the specification file to generate type-safe TypeScript code.

## Steps

1. **Find the specification file**

   Look for `spec.yaml` in the project root or the path provided by the user.

2. **Run the compiler**

   ```bash
   openboundary compile spec.yaml
   ```

   Or with a custom path:

   ```bash
   openboundary compile path/to/spec.yaml
   ```

3. **Check the output**

   The compiler will:
   - Validate security boundaries
   - Enforce middleware invariants
   - Generate TypeScript project files

4. **Report results**

   Show the user:
   - Success/failure status
   - Any validation warnings
   - List of generated files
   - Next steps (implement usecases)

## Expected Output

```text
$ openboundary compile spec.yaml
Validated security boundaries
Enforced middleware invariants
Generated TypeScript project
```

## Error Handling

If compilation fails:

1. Show the error message
2. Explain what went wrong
3. Suggest fixes (usually in spec.yaml or openapi.yaml)
4. Do NOT attempt to fix generated files

## After Compilation

Remind the user that:

- Generated files are marked with `// Generated by OpenBoundary - DO NOT EDIT`
- Usecase implementation bodies are safe to edit
- Config files remain unchanged and are safe to modify
