## v0.1.0

Initial release of the OpenBoundary specification compiler.

### Compiler

- YAML specification format with version, name, and component declarations
- Four-phase IR builder with symbol table and dependency graph
- JSON Schema validation with embedded `openboundary.schema.json`
- Component kind schema validation
- Semantic validation (unique IDs, required fields)
- IR validation with cycle detection and cross-component constraints
- Position-tracked error reporting with source file, line, and column

### CLI

- `bound compile <spec-file>` — Compile a spec into a TypeScript project
- `bound validate <spec-file>` — Validate a spec without generating code
- `--output` / `-o` flag for custom output directory (default: `generated/`)

### Component Kinds

- **http.server** — Hono framework with middleware chains, route registration, and dependency injection
- **middleware** — Authentication (better-auth) and authorization (Casbin) providers
- **postgres** — PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM with schema imports
- **usecase** — Business logic handlers bound to HTTP routes with goals, actors, and acceptance criteria

### Code Generation

- Plugin registry with conditional activation based on component kinds
- Artifact planner with conflict detection and deduplication
- Nine TypeScript generator plugins:
  - Project scaffolding (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`)
  - Database and middleware schema generation
  - OpenAPI type generation from parsed specs
  - Hono context and dependency injection wiring
  - Server entry point with route and middleware setup
  - Use case handler stubs with structured comments
  - Unit test scaffolding
  - Docker and docker-compose generation
  - End-to-end test scaffolding

### Standards Integration

- OpenAPI 3.x for HTTP contract definitions
- Drizzle ORM for database schema management
- Casbin for authorization policies (model + policy files)
- better-auth for authentication configuration
