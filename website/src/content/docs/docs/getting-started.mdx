description: Install OpenBoundary and generate your first type-safe backend in minutes.
---

Get up and running with OpenBoundary in four steps.

## 1. Install

Build the compiler from Go source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openboundary/openboundary.git
cd openboundary
go build -o openboundary ./cmd/openboundary
```

## 2. Create spec

Generate a YAML specification defining routes, middleware, and database schema:

```bash
openboundary init basic -o my-project
```

## 3. Generate

Compile spec to a TypeScript/Hono server with type-safe routing and middleware:

```bash
openboundary compile spec.yaml -o generated
```

## 4. Run

Install dependencies and start the generated server:

```bash
cd generated
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

- Explore the [Component Catalog](/docs/components/) to see what you can define
- Learn about [HTTP Servers](/docs/components/http-server) for routing and middleware
- Check the [CLI Reference](/docs/cli) for all available commands
