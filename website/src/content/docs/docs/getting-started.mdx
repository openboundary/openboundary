description: Install OpenBoundary and compile your first specification.
---

Install the CLI and compile a specification in four steps.

## 1. Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openboundary.org/install.sh | sh
```

Or with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/openboundary/openboundary/cmd/bound@latest
```

## 2. Create spec

Generate a YAML specification defining routes, middleware, and database schema:

```bash
bound init basic -o my-project
```

## 3. Generate

Compile spec to a TypeScript/Hono server with type-safe routing and middleware:

```bash
bound compile my-project/spec.yaml
```

## 4. Run

Install dependencies and start the generated server:

```bash
cd my-project/generated
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

- Explore the [Component Catalog](/docs/components/) to see what you can define
- Learn about [HTTP Servers](/docs/components/http-server) for routing and middleware
- Check the [CLI Reference](/docs/cli) for all available commands
